## R5 - Wireframes

The following wireframes were created using Figma and will provide a visual representation of the Recipe Realm app. The wireframes will show the layout of the app on different devices, and the user interaction flow.

The app will consist of the following main pages, with subpages where necessary:

- Index page where they will view, search and filter recipes
- Single recipe page where they will view the recipe details
- Login page where they will be able to login to their account, or register for a new account
- User home page where they will be able to view their saved recipes, comments, ratings, and submitted recipes  

###### *User login and user homepage for comments and ratings are optional features based on time allowance

### Hand Sketch

During the concept stage of the project, a rough hand sktech was create to layout what pages the app would have a basic layout of the pages.

## R6 - Project Management & Trello board screenshots

For this project we have decided to use the Agile methodology for project management. This will see the quick completion of tasks, daily stand ups of what tasks have been completed and will be completed in the next 24 hours, and flexibility to changes to the requirements to the project.

This will be managed is Trello, a Kanban style project management tool, where individual tasks are noted on seperate cards. Each card will have properties to determine which member of the group it is assigned to, when it is due, and the estimated time to complete the task. Within the cards there are also sub-lists, to further breakdown the tasks and allow for incremental progress to be seen.
